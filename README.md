Sudoku solver

## Another Haskell demo

This program follows a similar approach to the king snake cube solver:

* Figure out how to represent a partial solution
* Write functions to check if a solution is valid
* Write functions to check if a solution is complete
* Generate a list of possible, candidate partial solutions, based on the current partial solution
* Recursively solve to obtain a list of complete solutions
